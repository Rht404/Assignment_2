    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex real-world entities by capturing only their essential characteristics and behavior while hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it. Abstraction is achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or even base classes that provide a common template for creating objects with specific behaviors. The main goal of abstraction is to create a clear and simplified model of the system, making it easier for developers to work with complex codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on the data within a single unit (a class). It is about hiding the internal implementation details of an object and providing a public interface to interact with it. The idea is to protect the object's data from direct access and modification by external code, ensuring that changes to the object's internal state can only be made through well-defined methods. Encapsulation helps in promoting data integrity and making the code more maintainable."

    "\n",
    "Ans-The 'abc' module stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides tools to create abstract base classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but are meant to serve as blueprints for other classes. Abstract base classes define a common interface that derived classes must adhere to, ensuring that certain methods or attributes are implemented in the derived classes.\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Data abstraction in programming refers to the process of exposing only relevant information while hiding the implementation details. In Python, we can achieve data abstraction using classes and access control mechanisms. The key idea is to encapsulate the data within the class and provide methods (getters and setters) to interact with that data, without directly exposing the underlying attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we can achieve data abstraction in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Private Attributes: \n",
    "By convention, Python uses a single underscore _ prefix for attributes that are intended to be private. Although Python doesn't strictly enforce access control, this naming convention signals to other developers that the attribute should not be accessed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Getters and Setters: \n",
    "Provide public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify the private attributes. These methods allow controlled access to the data and enable validation or other operations if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation:\n",
    "Provide clear documentation for the class and its methods, explaining their purpose and usage. This helps users understand how to interact with the class without needing to know its internal details"
