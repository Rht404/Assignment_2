    "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (also known as properties or data members) and methods (also known as functions or behaviors) that the objects of that class will possess. Think of a class as a blueprint for a specific type of entity in the real world or an abstract concept in the program. It encapsulates the data and behaviors related to that entity.\n",
    "In the context of OOP, a class provides a way to create objects with specific characteristics and functionalities without having to recreate them from scratch every time. It acts as a prototype from which multiple objects can be instantiated."

    "Ans-\n",
    "The four pillars of  OOPs (object-oriented programming) are data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data abstraction- is the process of hiding unnecessary details of an object’s internal structure. By abstracting an object’s data, its structure and behavior can be kept separate and more easily understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Encapsulation- is the process of wrapping data and related functions into a single unit (object). Encapsulation limits access to object data and methods, preventing their misuse and ensuring their proper functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance- is the ability to create a new class (child class) from an existing one (parent class). The child class typically inherits the attributes (members and methods) of the parent class, although it can also redefine them. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism- is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement a certain interface (have methods of the same name)."

    "Ans-The __init__() function, also known as the constructor, is a special method in Python classes. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created. The primary purpose of the __init__() function is to initialize the object's attributes with specific values or perform any setup that needs to be done before the object is ready for use.\n"

    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called the derived class or subclass) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (called the base class or superclass). In other words, the subclass can reuse the properties and methods of the superclass, and it can also add its own unique attributes and behaviors or override existing ones if needed. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and the creation of a hierarchical relationship among classes.\n",
